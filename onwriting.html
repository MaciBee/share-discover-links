<h3> Ricky Gervais: write about what you known </h3> 
<p> Probably the greatest single influence on my creative process is my old english teacher said to me when I was about 13-14. <mark>He just said write about what you know </mark> </p>
<p> I wrote in every detail- the smell of tea, lavendar and mold..i did it all...</p>
<p> It sort of taught me that being honest is what counts. <i>trying to make the ordinary, extraordinary is so much better than starting w/ the extraordinary. Because it doesn't really connect. </i> </p>
<p> If something is real for one person, it's touched their life, I think as a creator and director, it's your job to make an audience as excited and facinated about a subject as you are. And real life does that. </p>
