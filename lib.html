<h4> Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure</h4>
<p>"Perhaps you should try a different approach, Jerry."</p>
<p>"Like what?" </p>
<p> He pointed to the clock on his wall. It was round with no numerals, only single tick marks for the hours. "What time is it?"</p>
<p> "Four-thirty." He walked over and rotated the clock a quarter turn to the right.  </p>
<p> "Now what time is it?" In its new position, the clock looked exactly as it had before, except for the position of the hands. </p>
<p> "Seven forty-five"</p>
<p> "Are you certain? Rotating a clock doesn't change the time, does it?" He had a point, but i idn't know what to make of it. </p>
<p>"It only says four-thirty because someone decided that's what it means. What's on the wall is a dial with two hands, yet what you see is the time." </p>
<p> I was still confused. He sighed, then continued. <mark> "All that's happened is that you've walked to the edge of the great mosaic of human knowledge. Up until now, you've been living in a world full of ideas and concepts that other people have set out for you. Now it's your turn. You get to design a piece of the mosaic and glue it down. It just has to fit with what else is there. And if you do a good job shaping your tile, it will be easier for the next person to fit his idea around yours."</mark> </p>
<p> "You're saying that I've been looking for an answer when really I should be making one up?" </p>
<p> He looked relieved. "Don't believe the bull about sicence being only an objective search for truth. It's not. Being a scientist also requires the skills of a politician. It's a struggle to define the terms, to guide the debate, and persuade others to see things your way. If you're the first one there"- againn he pointed to the clock-"you get to say what it is that others will see."
<p>....</p>
<p> "Just remember that ideas last longer than people or things. Your ideas will go further if you don't insist on going with them." 
<p> You know, he was not wrong. </p>
