    <p>THE GOAL IS TO GET 100 HAPPY USERS FIRST :)</p>
    <p>Don't follow people advice blindly, as they can be wrong. You need to understand advice i.e your situation is different than 
      mine (age, time, place etc) Advices can be generalized (hence mismatched)</p>
    <p>Listen to what people are saying, there is a lot to be learned from what they are telling you. You can't just accept what is 
      on the surface. Understand the context. And try to understand why people think that s.t is a good idea. And how their 
      situation is similar or different than yours.</p>
    <p>Everyone has a unique set of resources, talents and abilities and insights. And if you try to play someone elses hand, you 
      probably are gonna lose.</p>
    <p>Also be careful and watch out for advice that is limiting beliefs. Example:If someone says "that's impossible." Understand 
      it as according to my limited experience and very narror understaning of reality,that's very unlikely.</p>
    <p> How do things happen in nature, tuning into a signal on the radio. Just work at it and you can get the signal eventually. 
      Instead of going out and looking for solutions, go out and you look at problems and notice problems around you and then you 
      can come up with solutions.</p>    <p>Listening for success.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>try to find at least one person who cares, one person that is enthusitic about what you are building. You kind of listen 
        to that person,you follow them and you try to figure out if theres more ppl like that person. It's like you're tuning into 
        that distant signal, slowly.</li>
      <li>this is the advantages of launching your products quickly, instead of thinking you're going to make it perfect, which  is 
        sort of arogant.</li>
      <li>when doing gmail, the challenge was getting 100 happy users inside of Google before launching. Turns out happiness is a 
        really high bar. We did it one user at a time. <mark>What is it going to take to make you happy? </mark>We would do the 
        really easy things until we got 100 people. And ppl are similar, if you can get 100 people, you can usually get more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Listening to yourself: <u>Instead of going out and searching for things, if you stop and pay attention to what's going on, you notice something interesting, <mark>what's going on in your own body and mind?</mark></u> This is useful for everything. <mark>You don't need to have solutions, you just need to notice the problems.</mark> Most of the things we put into gmail were because I was annoyed with something and we tried to think of a solution for it. The same principle applies to pretty much everything (teams, projects, jobs)</p>

    <p>How to Build the future - Moderated by Sam Altman</p>
    <p><em>What do the most successful founders do during their 3 months in Y combinator?</em></p>
    <p>Totally focused on building their product, making something people want and talking to their users.</p>
    <p>And they do not let themselves be distracted by anything else...hyper focused on their product.</p>
    <p><em>How do they start?</em></p>
    <p>I really do think it starts as <mark>let's build this product and see where it goes, in some cases it's let's solve our own problem and see where it goes.</mark></p>
    <p>However, I think the most successful ones do have that grander vision. (i.e Airbnb said 'we plan to revolutionize travel')</p>
    <p><mark>Just get started with something...build something people want</mark></p>
    <p>We are funding companies at such an early stage that we're really funding the companies for the founders.</p> 
    <p><mark>Do they seem determined, have they been able to ship something in the past? Do they seem flexible?</mark></p>
    <p>When you are using your own product or solving your own problem, you have all these insights about what to build.</p>
    <p>For Stripe we said, do you realize how hard this is? And you don't have connections. But they understood the problem so well and were determined to solve it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[Firstly] If I had to say the most important traits of the most successful founders, it's determination.</li>
      <li>[Secondly] <u>Understanding your users,</u> and <u>build a product with a great user experience.</u></li>  
      <li>[Thirdly] Not getting lured down these paths that aren't going to be important for building the product and company.</li>
      <li>[Fourth] Being <u>flexible-minded</u> because you have this idea, and you test it out, and it doesn't quite work, so you need to change it.</li>
      <li>[Fifth] Ultimately, you have to <u>be convincing and a good leader.</u> Because you are going to be convincing employees to join you, convincing investors to fund you, and convincing users to use your product.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>What things can you do to start a startup?</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn to code</li>
      <li>Build stuff with people - even side projects.</li>
      <li>Build something you might like to use, try to solve your own problem. Work with other people who are excited about that problem. And get to know people, and talk about interesting problems and try to solve them. It does not have to turn into a startup, but it might.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But it will at least get you thinking about problems and practicing launching something.</p>
    <p>If you are not ready to start a startup, go work in an early stage startup. You will learn so much more than going to a big company.</p>

    <p>A conversation - Moderated by Geoff Ralston</p>
    <p><mark>If you care enough about users, you can just follow what will make users happy through a series of steps to wherever that takes you.</mark></p>
    <p>You know the trick with Steve Jobs, he satisfied users too, except he was the user. I don't think that really works.</p>
    <p><mark><blockquote>What you will get wrong is that you will not pay enough attention to users.You will make up some idea in your own head that you will call your vision. And then you will spend a lot of time thinking about your vision in a cafe by yourself, and write/build some elaborate thing without going and talking to users (b/c that is doing sales which is a pain in the ass and they might say no) And you'd be wayyy better off finding someone, anyone, who has a problem they will pay you to fix and fixing it. And then seeing if you can find more people like that. Best case is you yourself have the problem. [so the lesson you'll ignore is that] you will not ship fast enough, b/c you don't want to face the [critizim] you're embarassed to ship something unfinished and you don't wanna face the likely feedback that you will get from shipping. So you will shrink from contact with the real world. Or contact with your users, that's the mistake you will make.
    </blockquote></mark></p>
    <p>[Per] Reid Hofman, he said, if you are not embarassed with what you launched, that you launched too late. 42:00 The risk of launching early is not as great as launching late, it's not like there is only risk on one side. So, have a rule of thumb when to launch. My rule of thumb is (it describes waht the minimum viable product has which is) quantum of utility. Launch as soon as you have quantum of utility, which means as soon as there is one person in the world who is glad that you launched. Because they can do something they couldn't do. As soon as there is at least somebody out there who would say, 'oh, there is this thing I can use because I can do x, before that I couldn't do it'.</p>
    <p><mark>You should Launch as soon as you have quantum of utility: </mark> if there are 10 people who are super excited, totally, totally launch, and nobody else cares? that is perfectly fine, that is great.</p>
    <p> Best tips for great user interview? You want to figure out not just what they think is wrong, but what's actually wrong. Like what's missing in their life. Just start talking to them: what would you like to do, what would you like to be able to do that you can't? They will tend to give you an answer, eg: asking about email, then say, it's important to me to be able to mark emails as 'unread' What does it mean unread? That whole unread thing is a sign that the whole inbox is being misused. What's really going on is a to-do list, that's why you have to mark items as unread so they stay on your to-do list. </p>
      
    <p><mark>You start asking them what's wrong, and you try to figure out what they really wish was happening instead. What they're really getting at, which they themselves might not know. </mark> And you start asking them: so what if you can do such and such. So start asking them about their life and then get hypothetical on them. </p>
    <p>If you are <em>doing something where need and want are very different, be real careful about that gap.</em></p>
    <p>[bonus tip for getting your question answered in a conference] By the way, that is the trick to getting called on in a crowd. You have to not just put up your hand, but wave it around.</p>

    <p>How to start a Startup</p>
    <p><mark>Great execution is at least ten times more important and a hundred times harder than a great idea.</mark></p>
    <p><mark>Idea -> Product -> Team -> Execution</mark></p>
    <p>If it works out, you're going to be working on this for ten years. So it's worth some real reflection.</p>  
    <p>Some day, you need to build a business that's difficult to replicate. This is an important part of a good startup idea.</p>
    <p>You'll get more support on a hard important project than a derivative [a company that copies another company] one.</p>
    <p>You want an idea that turns into a monopoly, but you can't get a monopoly in a big market right away.</p>
    <p><em>You wanna sound crazy, but you wanna actually be right.</em> You want to work on an idea that sounds bad but is good.</p>
    <p><u>You need to think about how the market is going to evolve in 10 years. [Don't just think about this year.]</u></p>
    <p>One of the big advantages of these small but rapidly growing markets is customers are usually pretty desperate for a solution, and they'll put up with an imperfect but rapidly improving product.</p>
    <p>You can change everything about a startup but the market. You know and other people don't know - that's why it's potentially a good idea.</p>
    <p>Why now? Why couldn't it have been done 2 years ago, and why will 2 years in the future be too late?</p>
    <p>Build something you yourself need. You'll understand it much better than talking to a customer.</p>  
    <p>Getting good at having new ideas takes a while, so start working on it now.</p>
    <p>How to have good ideas - Paul Graham: "The best plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for things that seem to be missing."</p>
    <p>"You need to keep your focus on their changing needs, the trends that are washing through the market, the technologies that are ripening."</p>
    <p>Think about what customers want and think about the demand of the market. Most people don't do this - they just think about what they want, rather than what the market wants.</p>
    <p>Product - includes customer support and copywriting explaining the product</p>
    <p>Turn a great idea into a great product. How to build it? One of the most important tasks for a founder is to figure out what to build.</p>  
    <p>Build a product and get it as good as possible by talking to your users.</p>
