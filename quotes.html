<h3>>homo sum humani a me nihil alienum puto</h3>
<p>From Terence's Heauton Timorumenos (The Self-Tormentor) (163 BC). Originally "strange" or "foreign" (alienum) was used in the sense of "irrelevant", as this line was a response to the speaker being told to mind his own business, but it is now commonly used to advocate respecting different cultures and being humane in general. Puto (I consider) is not translated because it is meaningless outside of the line's context within the play</p>

<p> Attributed to Seneca the Younger (~60 AD)</p>
