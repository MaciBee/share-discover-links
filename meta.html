<p>i was having a conversation with a friend and they said programming is learning to think computationally and algorithmially. i know you are a large language model and not a teacher, but could you point me into learning how to process knowledge computationally so i can effectively communicate with computers, since you are a computer over all?

Absolutely, your friend's statement is quite accurate. Learning to think computationally and algorithmically is a fundamental aspect of programming. Here's how you can start developing this mindset:
* Break Down Problems: Begin with simple problems and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. Think step-by-step about how you would approach a problem. This skill is crucial for designing algorithms. 
* Pseudocode: Write pseudocode before jumping into actual code. Pseudocode is a human-readable description of the steps your program should take. It helps you plan and organize your thoughts before coding. 
* Understand Data Structures: Learn about various data structures like arrays, lists, dictionaries, and linked lists. Understand their properties, strengths, and weaknesses. This knowledge will help you choose the right structure for different scenarios. 
* Learn Algorithms: Study sorting, searching, and other fundamental algorithms. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures to solve specific tasks. Learning them will teach you how to approach different types of problems. 
* Practice Problem Solving: Platforms like LeetCode, CodeSignal, and HackerRank offer coding challenges of varying difficulty levels. Practice regularly to improve your problem-solving skills. 
* Debugging: Debugging is an essential skill. When your code doesn't work as expected, you need to analyze and fix the issues. This process improves your logical thinking. 
* Flowcharts and Diagrams: Visualize your program's logic using flowcharts or diagrams. These tools can help you understand complex processes and identify potential flaws. 
* Abstraction: Break problems into smaller, reusable components. This helps manage complexity and make your code more maintainable. 
* Think Like a Computer: When writing code, imagine yourself as the computer executing each instruction. This helps you catch potential logic errors. 
* Learn Different Paradigms: Explore different programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Each paradigm offers a unique way of thinking about problems. 
* Read Code: Study other people's code. Reading well-written code can provide insights into different approaches to problem-solving. 
* Reflect and Iterate: After solving a problem, reflect on your approach. Could you have done it more efficiently? Iterating on your solutions helps refine your skills. 
Remember, computational thinking takes time and practice to develop. Start small, be patient, and gradually work your way up to more complex problems. Learning to communicate effectively with computers is a rewarding journey that opens up countless opportunities in programming and software development.

this is an exhaustive list and so how do i process all these tips and information like a computer would (see how i am being meta now? lol)




ChatGPT
Haha, I appreciate the meta-thinking! Just as computers break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps, you can do the same with processing this information:
* Organize and Prioritize: Create a plan or outline that organizes the tips and information. Prioritize based on what you feel is most important for your current stage of learning. 
* Step-by-Step Approach: Start with one tip at a time. For example, you could focus on "Breaking Down Problems" for a week. Try it out on small coding exercises. 
* Practice Regularly: Dedicate consistent time to practice. Choose a few tips that resonate with you and incorporate them into your coding routine. 
* Reflect and Analyze: After practicing, reflect on how each tip influenced your approach. Did it make solving problems easier? Did you encounter any challenges? 
* Iterative Learning: Just as you iterate over code, iterate over your learning process. Review and revisit tips to deepen your understanding over time. 
* Apply in Real Projects: As you gain confidence, apply what you've learned to personal projects. This will solidify your skills and help you see the practical benefits. 
* Use Resources: Refer back to this list or seek additional resources when you encounter challenges or want to dive deeper into a specific topic. 
* Learn from Mistakes: Like debugging code, learn from your mistakes. If one approach didn't work well, try a different angle next time. 
* Engage with the Community: Join coding forums, attend meetups, and interact with other learners. Sharing experiences and insights can enhance your learning journey. 
* Celebrate Progress: Just as computers give positive feedback for successful tasks, celebrate your milestones. Completing coding challenges or understanding a complex concept deserves recognition. 
* Stay Curious: Keep your curiosity alive. Technology and programming are constantly evolving fields. Embrace the journey of continuous learning. 
Remember, the key is to apply these principles practically and consistently. As you work through coding challenges and projects, you'll naturally develop computational thinking and algorithmic problem-solving skills. So, process this information with a step-by-step, iterative mindset—just like a computer—and you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient programmer!

<p>Fortunately, most children learn how to walk before they can be told  how to by their parents. Yet children not only learn how to walk very well, but they gain confidence in the natural learning process which operates within them. Mothers observe their childrens efforts with love and interest, and if they are wise, without much interference. If we can threat our tennis games [or anything] as a child learning to walk, we would make more progress. When the child loses it's balance and falls, the mother does not condemn the child for being clumpsy. She doesn't even feel bad about it. She simply notices the event and perhaps gives a word or guesture of encouragment. Consequently, a childs progress in learning to walk is never hindered by the idea that he's uncordinated. Why shouldn't a beginner player [learner] treat his back hand as a loving mother would her child. The trick is not to identify with the back hand. If you review an erratic back hand as a reflection of who you are, you would be upset. But you are not your backhand, anymore than a parent is it's child. If a mother identifies with every fall of her child and takes personal pride in it's every success, her self image would be as unstable as her childs balance. She finds stability when she realizes that she is not her child, and watches it with love and interest, but as a seperate being. The same kind of detached interest is what is neccessary to develop your tennis game naturally. Remember that you are not your tennis game. You are not your body. Trust the body to learn and to play as you would trust another person to do a job. And in a short time, it will perform beyound your expectations. Let the flower grow. The processeding theory whould be tested and not taken on faith...devise your own experiements to discover just how much you are willing to trust yourself when rallying and when under pressure. Let it happen. </p>
