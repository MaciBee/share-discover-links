share-discover-links intent is three-fold: 
1) to save any link and have it accessible from anywhere by simiply siging in
2) to discover amazing learning resources and materials that are submitted by the community to help you be an efficent learner 
3) organize said materials so they are easy to find and be discovered. (current phase) 

the naming of these docs suck (sorry still learning) but they are divided into linksharing.js which houses the main code
the api, and server stuff are in public folder. 

ya thats it. 

project background- started in summer 2024 but abandoned it for a bit and now winter 2024 we are back full steam.

the super challenge with this project has been **figuring out how to organize and index data/links.** i am currently figuring out wtf to do to make it more engaging and helpful for users (so far onone seems to care :/) 
the next evolution of this project: how can we make finding resources (links) for learners so effortless that this site is the first thing a person looks at when they want to learn something (as gpt called it "building a site that feels like Yahoo! in 1994 if it went to therapy") 

next step: 
figuring out better link schematics - maybe its better UI but i've a feeling it'll require more architectural designy stuff. if you have thoughts or want to collaborate on this, feel free- idk how yet but we'll find out soon. 

ok thanks for reading. i might or might be stressed as i write this. xx HAY
