        <h1>Simple Example Code</h1>
        <pre>
            <code>
                print("Hello, World!")
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h1> Code Explination and Breakdown </h1>
		<code>
 Principles of why and how: 
The print here is a function- which is like a shortcut computers use to do repetitive action and it comes preinstalled in the computer. So it's a way of saying to the computer 'you are about to speak.' the () is a confiner so it knows the start and end. Quotation marks, double or single are a way to know it's a sentence- called a string. I could say print(5) and I won't need '' symbole because it's a number- aka an integer written as int. 
AKA: print() is a function - a pre-defined shortcut that the computer can use to quickly perform a common task (in this case, outputting text to the console).
The parentheses () enclose the argument(s) that the function operates on. In this case, the string "hello world!" is the argument being passed to the print() function.

name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name + "!")            </code>
