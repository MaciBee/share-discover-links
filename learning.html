<p>Git Tutorial For Dummies </p> 
<p> Expanded: Git is like a magic book that keeps track of all your coloring changes, so you can always look back and see what you did on any day.

GitHub is like a special shelf in your house where you put copies of your magic book so that your friends can see your coloring pages from their houses.

 Personal Access Tokens (PATs): Magic Words to Open Your Special Shelf
To open your special shelf (GitHub) and put your magic book there, you need a magic word. This magic word is called a Personal Access Token (PAT). It's special because only you know it, and it lets you open the shelf without having to ask your mom or dad every time

SSH Keys: Secret Handshake: computer does a secret handshake with GitHub every time it wants to put your coloring pages on the shelf, so GitHub knows it's really you.
Adding: You tell your magic book, "I want to save this page when I'm done today." This is like putting the page in a special box.
Saving (Committing): At the end of the day, you tell your magic book, "Okay, save everything in the box now." The magic book takes a picture and saves it forever.

 Sending Your Coloring Pages to the Shelf (Pushing)
When your magic book has saved new pages, you might want to put those in your special shelf (GitHub) so your friends can see:

You take all the new pages you've saved, and send them to your shelf. This is called pushing. Now your friends can see all the new and changed coloring pages from their own houses!
