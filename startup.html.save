<h5><mark> "DO IT LIGHTWEIGHT, START SMALL AND EVOLVE."</mark> </h5>
<p>Jessica Livingston- How to Build the future- Moderated by Sam Altman </p>
<h5> what do the most successful founders do during their 3 months in Y combinator? </h5>
<p>totally focused on building their product,  making something people want and talking to their users. And theydo not let themselves be distracted by anything else...hyper focused on their product </p
<p>How do you know when you have hit the product?</p>
<p>When you have ppl using it. You can measure your growth, you can measure how many users you get, are they coming back? Are thy paying for your product? I mean, that is the greavest thing of all when you can charge for yur product and that growth rate is going up? </p>
<p> I really do think it starts as <mark> let's build this product and see where it goes, in some cases, let's solve our own problem and see where it goes.</mark> (Ex  Stripe) they were solving something for themselves. However, i think the most successful ones do have that grander vision. (i.e Arbnb said we plan to become the Ebay of space when they were nowhere near the ebay of space at that point they had that vision and they were working toward that. </p>  
 
<p><mark>Just  get started   with  something...build somthing people want</mark> </p>

<p> we are funding companies at such an early stage that we're really funding the companie for the founders and for the attribute of the founders. Do they seem to be.. <li>
<mark>do they seem determined, have they been able to ship somthing in the past? do they seem open minded about things? are they domain experts?</mark> </li> 
<p> when you are using your own product or solving your own problem, you have all these insights that noone has (i.e Airbnb were renting up a room in their apartment bc they couldn't pay their own rent, so they had a lot of insights into this idea) </p>

<p> For stripe we said, do you realize how hard this is? And you don't have connections. But they were intrepid, they were like, 'well we don't have connections, we'll find connections'. How determined they were, how focused they were. <p>
<p>If I had to say the most important traits of the most succesful founders, determination is by far the most important quality. More than intelligence, more than previous success in school. Determination is the most important thing. [Secondly] understanding your users, and building a product with a great user experience. [Thirdly] Not getting lured down these paths that aren't going to be important for building your product. {Fourth] being flexible-minded bc you have this idea, and you test it out, and it doesn't always work the first time and so you have to be able to say 'ok i thought I was gonna do this, but let's try this even though i have lot of energy vested in this, lets try this direction.' You have to be open-minded. [Fivth] Ultimately, you have to be convincing and a good leader. Bc you are going to be convincing employees to join you, you going to be convincing investors to invest in you...your whole world is convincing people. And so you have to be able to communicate your idea and convince ppl why they should care about you.</p>

<P> DO IT LIGHTWEIGHT, START SMALL AND EVOLVE. </P>

<p> Some things you can do to start a startup? <li> learn to code. Build stuff with people, even side projects. Build something you might like to use, try to solve your own problem. Work with other people. And get to know people, and talk about interesting problems and try to solve them. It does not have to be the next start up. But it will at least get you thinking about prolems and get you like practing launcing something, and listening to users, and talking to users. And after that, if you are not ready to start a startup, go work in an early stage startup. You will learn so much </p>
<p> As a woman founder, I have always kept focused on my product, and what i'm doing and I don't listen to all of this stuff going on and I'm building a product people love. </p>

<p>pay enough attention to your users </p>
A conversation- Moderated by Geoff Ralst/p>n
<p> <mark>If you care enough about users, you can just follow what will make users happy the way a scientist follows the truth.</mark> And eventually without thinking on your part the need to grow will give you this product idea that is the result of evolution. </p>
<p> You know the trick with Steve Jobs, he satisified users too, accept he was the user. I don't want to have any phone jack anymore, so no more phone jacks for anybody...he was living in the future. </p>
<p><mark> What you will get wrong is that you will not pay enough attention to users. You will make up some idea in your own head that you will call your vision.</mark> And then you will spend a lot of time thinking about your vision in a cafe by yourself, and write/build some elaborate thing without going and talking to users (b/c that is doing sales which is a pain in the ass and they might say no) And you'd be wayyy better off finding someone, anyone, who has a problem they will pay you to fix and fixing it. And then seeing if you can find more people like that. Best case is you yourself have the problem. [so the lesson you'll ignore is that] you will not ship fast enough, b/c you don't want to face the [critizim] you're embarassed to ship something unfinished and you don't wanna face the likely feedback that you will get from shipping. So you will shrink from contact with the real world. Or contact with your users, that's the mistake you will make. [Per] Reid Hofman, he said, if you are not embarassed with what you launched, that you launched too late. 42:00 The risk of launching early is not as great as launching late, it's not like there is only risk on one side. So, have a rule of thumb when to launch. My rule of thumb is (it describes waht the minimum viable product has which is) quantum of utility. Launch as soon as you have quantum of utility, which means as soon as there is one person in the world who is glad that you launched. Because they can do something they couldn't do. As soon as there is at least somebody out there who would say, 'oh, there is this thing I can use because I can do x, before that I couldn't do it'. then You should Launch. As soon as you have quantum of utility. If there are 10 people who are super excited, totally, totally launch, and nobody else cares? that is perfectly fine, that is great.</mark>  52:00  </p>   
<p> [bonus tip for getting ur question answered in a conference] By the way, that is the trick to getting your question answered, you raise your hand as ppl are finishing the procceding question</p>
<p> Best tips for great user interview? You want to figure out not just what they think is wrong, but what's actually wrong. Like what's missing in their life. Just start talking to them: what would you like to do, what would you like to be able to do that you can't? they will tend to give you an answer, eg: asking about email, thesay, it's important to me to be able to mark emails as 'unread' What does it mean unread? That whole unread thing is a sign that the whole inbox is being misused. What's really going on is a to-do list, that's why you have to mark items as unread so they stay on your to-do list. So, <mark>you start asking them with what's wrong, and you try to figure out what they really mean, what they're really getting at, which they themselves might not know. And you start asking them: so what if you can do such and such. So start asking them about their life and then get hypothetical on them</mark> 52:00</p>
<p> If you doing something where need and want are very different, be real careful about picking need. Or you'll go out and your goal will be to cleanse the world of sin. The other danger is what you implicitily talking about is what you think they need, cleanse the world of your definition of sin. </p>

Sam Altman How to start a Startup 
<h4> <mark>Great execution is at least ten times more important and a hundred times harder than a good idea </mark> </h4>
<p>Idea, Product, team, execution </p>
<p> If it works out, you're going to be working on this for ten years. So it's worth some real upfront time to think of the long term value and the definessibility. </p>
<p> <mark>Some day, you need to build a business that's difficult to replicate.</mark> This is an important part of a good idea </p> 
<p>You'll get more support on a hard important project than a derivative[a company that copy an existing ideawith very few new insights] one. When it comes to starting a startups, in many ways, it's easier to start a hard startup than an easy startup. this is one of the cpunter intiutve things that takes ppl a long time to understand. </p>
<p>You want an idea that turns into a monopoly, but you can't get a monopoly in a big market right away, too much competition for that. You have to find a small market in which you can get a monopoly and then quickly expand.</p>
<p>You wanna sound crazy, but you wanna actually be right. You want to work on an idea other peopleare working on. It needs to takeover a specific market and expand from there. That's how most successful companies have started. Unpopular but right, is what you're going for. You want something that sounds like a bad idea, but is a good idea. </p> 
<p> you need to think about how the markaket is going to evolve in 10 years. [Don't just think of the growth of the startup, but how the market is going to evolve] I care much more about the growth rate of the marketthan it's current size. And I also care if there is any reason that it's gonna top out. You should think about this, I prefer to invest in a company that's going after a small but rapidly growing market than a big but slow growing one. </p>
<p>one of the big advantages of these mall but rapidly growing market is customers are usually pretty desperate for a solution and they will put up with imperfect, but rapidly improving product. </p>
<p> you can change everything about a startup but the market. You know and other people don't the [market] is going to grow reallyfast. think about where this is happening in the world. You need a sort of tailwind to make a startup successful. </p>
<p>why noww? why couldn't it have been done 2 years ago, and why will 2 years in the future be too late</p>
<p>Build something you, yourself need. You'll understand it much better than talking to a customer. </p> p>Getting good on having new ides vakes a while, so start working on it now. </p> {How? read Paulg Graham essay 'How to Get Startup Ideas == summary is notice the gap= Live in the future and build what seems interesting} </p>
<p> "You need to keep your focus on their changing needs, the trends that are washing through them. Beginning with their demand, you treate the appropriate supply" - 50 cent </p>
<p> think about what customers want and think about the demand of the market. Most ppl don't do this, if you can do this one thing- if you can just learn to think of the market first, you'll have a big leg up on most ppl starting startups. </p>

<p>product-includes customer support and copyright explaining the product
</p>
<p> turn great idea into great product. How to build it? One of the most impo. task for a founder is the company builds a great product. Until you build a great product, almost nothing else matters. </p>
<p> Build a product and get it as good as possible by talking to your users. </p> 


 Sam Altman *Lecture 2* Execution

<p>What being a founder means is signing up for this years long grind on exectuion, and you can't outsource this.<mark> The way to have a company that executes well is to execute well yourself. Everything in a startup gets modeled after the founders. Whatever the founders do becomes the culture </mark> So if you want a culture where people work hard and pay attention to detail and focus on the customer and are frugal, you have to do it yourself, there is no other way. The company needs to see you as like this maniacal execution machine. </p>
<p>There's like a hundred times at least more people with great ideas than people that are willing to put in the effort to execute them well. Ideas by themselves are not worth anything, only executing well is what adds value, what creaes value. </p>
<p><mark>A big part of execution is just putting in the effort. But there is a lot you can learn about how to be good at it. </p>
<p>In early days the job of a CEO mainly includes- setting the execution bar- i.e make sure the entire company executes. </p>
<p>execution gets divided into two key questions: <mark>Can you figure out what do do? and Can you get it done? </mark>
<p> Can you get it done = Focus + Intensity</p>
<p> Focus is critical- one of my fav questions to ask founders is 'what are you spending your time and money on?' This reveals almost everything about what founders think is important. One of the hardest things about being a founder is there are a hundred things competing for your attention every day. And you have to identify the right two or three, work on those and then ignore or delegate or defer the rest. </p>
<p>What really does matter varies with time but it's an important May Day advice: <mark>You need to figure out what the two or three important things are and then just do those. </mark> And you can only have 2 or 3 things everyday b/c everything else will just come at you. You know, fires of the day and if you don't get really good at setting what these 2 or 3 priorities are everyday, you will never be great at actually getting stuff done. </p>
<p>The trick to great execution is to say no alot. You're saying no 97 times out of a 100. Most startups are not nearly focused enough; they work really hard, maybe, but they don't work hard on the right things. And you'll still fail. You get no credit for trying, you only get points when you make something that the market wants. </p>
<p> <mark> How do you figure out what to focus on each day? And this is where it is really important to have goals. Most good founders that I know, at any given time have a small number of overarching goals for the company. Everybody in the company knows...anybody could tell you in the company every week what are our key goals and everybody executes based off of that </mark> </p>
<p>Whatever the founder cares about, whatever the founders think are the key goals, that's going to be what the whole copny focuses on. And the best founders repeat these goals over and over far more often than they think they should need to.. one of the keys to focused is great communication. Even 4=5 ppl in a company, <mark> a small communication breakdown is enough for everybody to be working on slightly different things and then you lose focus and the company just scrambles </mark </p>
<p> Growth and momentum are what a startup lives on, and you always have to focus on maintaining these. You should always know how you are doing against your metrics, you should have a weekly meeting every week.</p> 
<p> You want to have the right metrics and you want to be focused on growing those metrics and having momentum. And don't let the company get distracted or excited by other things. </p>
<p>Intensity</p>
<p>?Startups only work at a fairly intense level. <mark>the secret to startup sucess is extreme focus and extreme dedication </mark> Startups are all consuming in a way that is difficult to explain. You generally need to be willing to outwork your competitors. The good news is that a small amount of extra work on the right thing makes a huge difference. Example: the viral coefficient for a consumer web product. How many new uswers each existing user brings in. If iv's .99 company eventually flatlines and die. If it's 1.01 you'll be in this happy place of exponential growth forever. </p>
<p> Relentless operating rhythm: ececution speed.
<p>Obsession with Execution Quality</p>
<p>Be decisive: indecisivness is a startup killer. You need bias toward action. The best founders work on things that seem small but they move really quickly. This is theon e thing we've learned that best predicts success of founders in YC, if everytime we talk to a team they've gotten new things done, that's the b best preidtor the company will go on to be successful. </p>
<p>Part of this is you can do <mark>huge things in incremental pieces if you just keep knocking down small chunks one at a time, in a year you look back you've done this amazing thing. <mark></p>Pick these right size projects- there is always a way to break it down into smaller projects. </p>
<p>So speed is this huge premium- they are generally quick. They get on planes in marginal situations. </p>
<p>Always keep momentum. If i can only tell founders one thing about how to run a company it would be this. For most software  startups this translates to keep growing and for hardware startups, don't let your ship date slip. </p>
<p> Get product right in the beginning is a good way to not lose momentum. And remember- <mark>Sales fix everything</mark> in a startup. So you figure out where  you can get these small wins and you get that done. </p>
<p>A framework- when there is disagreement smong the team about what to do, then you ask your users and you do whatever your user tell you. </p>
