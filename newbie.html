<title> Welcome new-bee </title> 
<p> <center> Welcome Scholar,  </center></p>

<p> Here is where we learn the foundation of mathematics! Being on this level is fun because once we master this, every other level will make a lot of sense. </p>
<p> There is nothing wrong with starting anew and making sure we have a good understanding of the basics. Acutally, the basics are the coolest part in math. Because every one- Hypatia, Sophie Germain, Ada Lovelace, Al-Khwarizmi, Einstein, Newton, Euclid and Feynman (all cool mathematicans) had to start from the basics. So we're in good company. </p>
<p> I am also a new-bee. Just like real bees, we will work <i> really </i> hard to collect 'honey', different knowledge that will allow us to advance to the next level. So, my bee friends, let's get beezy and start learning</p>

<p>Sometimes when we solve math problems, we will (surely) get stuck. And that is good, it means we have reached our limit of understanding. </p>
<p> Don't feel bad, it's normal. Just like when we do a lot of exercises, we feel tired, our brain is also like that, when it doesn't know something, sometimes it feels bad about itself. It might even whisper 'i'm no good', 'this is too hard' 'i should quit'</p>
<p> All these feelings are normal and okay. We have a few ways of dealing with this 'challenge'</p>
<p> Just the same way when you hit a new level on a game, you feel stuck, you don't just quit the game and never play it again, where is the fun in that??</p> 
<p> you try hard, you find a different way to beat the game. Here are some helpful tips:</P
<ul> 
<li>First, we break the probelm to it's tinniest part. </li>
<li>We ask ourselves: 'where exactly did I get stuck?'</li>
<li>We work on locating the tricky part. | And we will work on understanding that </li>
<li> We might go solve an easier problem and get back to this trick monster just when it least expects it (take that trick monster!!! kapow!)</li>
<li>Call a friend (a tutor) to help you get unstuck.</li>
<li>We will solve it together, because we want to make as much honey as we can so we can enjoy it with our friends. </li>

</ul>

<h4> What is in a name </h4> 
//<p> Have you ever heard of Romeo and Juliet, there is a famous line where Juliet says, 'what is in a name, would a rose by any other name smell as sweet? </p> 
//<p> so as bees, we want to know, would a number by another other name work? </p>

<p> a number,simply put is a way of representing a figure in the easiest way possible. For a long time people used to count with their fingers (1- 10) and it would be a looong time before the concept of 0 was formally written out </p> 
<p> so it's easier to say I am 10 years old versus I have been alive for three thousand six hundred and fifty days. Or simply put 365 ( there are 365 days in a year, and i have been alive for 10 years. so multpily 10 * 365 (click here to learn multiplication:) </p>
