<h1>Teach yourself....Javascript in terminal</h1>
<p>Notes on steps taken to download the various things to run JS</p>
<p> run mkdir to run new directory under the root</p>
<p>mkdir test.npm </p>
<p>npm being a node package manager for node.js</p>
<p>cd test.npm to go into the directory ? </p>
<p>root@blah :~test.npm# </p>
<p>to be able to run json files- need to install node.js at node.js.org > Debian and ubuntu based linux >@github scroll to installation instructions > install Debian as root in terminal </p>
<p>which will automatically install the .json packages such such as package-lock.json </p>
<p>nano test.js (note: nano both a text editor and a file creator</p>
<p>Now to ways to run javascript 1. in the terminal itself: which means under.npm directory you nano test.js file and use console.log("hello world") for script and console.log(5+6); for string</p>
<p>node test.js to run program in terminal</p>
<p>the second method is more complex .>dowload express.js in terminal</p>
<p>after copy the code example in express.js which will be: const app=express() ...const port = 3000 etc etc etc </p>
<p>Save the code in the nano test1.js then in diractory run a node test1.js</p>
<p>to see the code you the ip address of the external server followed by :3000 to see the code </p>
<p>In the terminal to get back to directory just Control(^)C </p>

<p>help me learn javascript using linux terminal for website development. i want to learn theroy with facts. Please present your answer in paragraph form. ok. now teach me, i am your pupil
:)
thanks in advance </p>

<p>Certainly! Embarking on the journey of mastering JavaScript through the lens of the Linux terminal will provide a robust foundation for website development. Let's delve into this:

---

**Setting the Stage with Linux and JavaScript**:

Linux, a versatile open-source operating system, is often the platform of choice for developers due to its configurability and rich set of tools. JavaScript, on the other hand, started as a browser scripting language but has evolved into a versatile, multi-paradigm language essential for web development and beyond. When combined, the Linux terminal and JavaScript offer a potent mix of tools and frameworks, making web development streamlined and powerful.

<br>
**Starting with the Basics**:

Before diving into JavaScript, ensure you're familiar with the Linux terminal. Basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and `nano` (or `vim`, if you're feeling adventurous) will be essential. With that in hand, install Node.js on your Linux system. Node.js is a runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript outside the browser, making it perfect for learning and development. Use a package manager like `apt` (for Debian-based distributions) or `yum` (for Red Hat-based distributions) to install Node.js.
<br>

**Exploring the Core of JavaScript**:

With Node.js installed, you can start writing JavaScript directly in your terminal by typing `node` to enter the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Here, you can execute any JavaScript statement and see its output instantly, making it perfect for experimentation. Delve into JavaScript's fundamentals, from data types (like numbers, strings, and objects) to control structures (like `if-else`, loops) and functions. Remember, JavaScript is an object-oriented and event-driven language, so understanding concepts like prototypes, closures, and asynchronous programming (promises and async/await) is crucial.
 <br>

**Web Development Essentials**:

While Node.js is excellent for backend development and scripting, JavaScript's primary domain is in the browser. Install a text editor (like `nano`, `vim`, or `VSCode` via Linux), and begin crafting HTML and JavaScript files. Familiarize yourself with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document. JavaScript interacts with the DOM to make web pages dynamic. Learn how to select elements, modify content, and handle events like button clicks.
<br>

**Frameworks and Tools**:

As you progress, you'll discover that the JavaScript ecosystem is vast. Tools like NPM (Node Package Manager) will become invaluable. NPM allows you to install libraries and frameworks, enhancing your development capabilities. For web development, libraries like jQuery simplify DOM manipulation, while frameworks like React and Vue.js offer advanced structures for building sophisticated web applications.
<br>
**Theory, Facts, and Continuous Learning**:

Always accompany your practical exercises with theoretical understanding. JavaScript, being a dynamic, weakly-typed language, has quirks. Understand type coercion, hoisting, and the event loop. Delve into the history and evolution of JavaScript, appreciating its evolution from a simple browser scripting tool to the robust language it is today. As a web developer, also stay updated on the continuously evolving web standards and best practices.

Remember, mastery is a journey. Regularly challenge yourself with projects, collaborate with the community, and always remain curious. Embrace the iterative nature of learning: code, make mistakes, debug, understand, and code again. The Linux terminal, combined with the vast landscape of JavaScript, will be your sandbox. Enjoy the journey!
