<h3> principle 1 Firewalking </h3>

You might have people who would learn from certain kind of experience or think they’re learning watching someone else go through something but they haven'You might have people who would learn from certain kind of experience or think they’ve learning watching someone else go through something but they haven’t driven the lesson into their being. So I have a process that I call fire walking which is basically training to learn from other people’s experiences or things you might read, with the same somatic intensity, physical intensity as if you experienced it yourself in a high pressure environment. For example if you overextend your arm in the world championship and you get your arm ripped off you are not going to overextend your arm that way again. But if you watch someone else do it and you might go have a sandwich, you might not really have learned that important lesson so deeply.

But if you develop the ability to anytime you see somebody making a mistake burn it into yourself somatically and get your whole being physiologically engaged with it. It’s a huge learning hack and it helps people. 
[people] intellectualize learning without translation into the full being 
A chess example: Studying the games of Bobby Fischer (and reading his annotations) I might learn X. But if I sit down and I play solitary chess as if I am Bobby Fischer, so I look the opponents movement and I struggle to find what Fischer did every move like I’m in a tournament game. And if I have the same vision (?) I go along, [and if it’s a] different decision, I look at the gap and I come back to try to figure out why and I go on. And then afterwards I study the annotation then I’ll learn a 1000x. So harnessing that full engagement will overcome most of the repetition of errors…

what I would recommend is cultivate the art when you learn something learn it as if you are the one running the show…that will eliminate repetition of error like you wouldn’t believe.
