<p> Discussion | Crowdsource | Analysis/synthasis | Last semesters notes | Western thought | Eastern thought * | 
Peripatetic | falsafa & Kalam | Aksum </p>
<p> How to build your own curiculum? </p> 
<p> takeaways: be a director of your own learning. | Schedule the times you'll learn: watch lectures, read, take notes, syntheize notes, write papers and (if applicable) take tests. | Being your own dean, professor and student is a great way to take charge of your own learning and deeply understand something. | And lastly, forming or joining disuccion groups is critical. Ask ppl who are in academic environments what that they are reading, what assiments they are doing {p.s are you able to get ppl to sumbit their notes so you can learn from their learnings - i.e last years notes. Even sumbit test questions- might be illegal tho xo} </p>
<p> notes should include 2/3 of the content and 1/3 of your own thinking. Do you agree/disagree? what did the author mean by ...., what motivates them to write that piece this way. Is there a more effective way? why should i listen to this person? If I were to disagree with them, what statments would I disagree with. And how will they defend their argument. And most importantly. WHAt IS tHE MAIN ARGUMENt, ACtUALLY </P>

<p> Self study. Create my own university courses | by ParkNotes </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Guided Studies: book recommendation, what paper will you consider writing. </li>
<li> What do you want to study? what are you interested in? what topic? </li>
	<li> Computer and computation </li>
<li> How many credits do you want it to be 2 1/2 hours two days a week = 3 credits </li>
<li> Course description? sylabus, what do you want to study? what you're going to achieve? - papers u write, codes you run, etc. 2 paper. Pracy-facts, what is author arguing. | A 1000 bbok review, main theme how author supported them etc. </li>
<li> Share some knowledge with people. so substack, blog etc to share findings. | Ask what books ppl recommend, what books should i read, what are the main papers that I ought to have read in my undergrad | crowdsource required reading </li> 
<li> Create playlist of lectures using Youtube </li>
<li> Discussing before and after class. For now using comments, 'Andy said this on his paper, what do you think?' You can create your cohort. More indepth book club. </li>
<li> Have a start and end time. Map out reading schdule. For reading, for watching lectures, for writing. </li>
</ul>

<p> How can i understand this problem? </p>
<p> <mark>  Reading: Dream Machine- history of computers | Eloquent Js | 100 lines of correct code | One small project - update to do list w/o terminal | extra credit for updating calendar </p> </mark>
<p> * cool to include these broad topics, college is an exploration of ideas you were not exposed to. What if western thought included the 100 greatest books of western literature, their philiosphies(sp) & contribution. Then have Easter thought, expose ppl to the early contributers of math and science, their 100 greatest books (and best translations) - this includes the Arabs, the Chinese/japanese etc, Indians | lastly also include 'central thought' coined by me? this includes Africas literature and philiosophy </p>
